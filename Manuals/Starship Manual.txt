Starship User Manual

Game Overview:
Starship is a game about surviving the barages of bullets thrown at you by enemies while collecting as 
much score as possible. As the level increases, the amount of time increases, as does the number of enemies. 
Starship was originally a game written for the GameBoy by HalloSpaceBoy, but was ported to the PicoBoy for its better graphics.

Important things to know:
- Your score will only be saved when you die; if you return to the home screen before that, your score will be
  lost.
- Collect all of the score boosters around the map to increase your score
- Your number of lives resets at the beginning of every level

Gameplay:
You control a spaceship, and your main goal is to dodge the projectiles fired at you by enemy ships. After a 
certian amount of time alive, you will pass the level and move on. If you lose all of your lives in this time, you
will get a game over. In Starship, there are two different kinds of enemies: static enemies and follower enemies. 
Static enemies will stay in place and fire at a set rate; follower enemies will follow you on whatever axis
they move on while firing at you. Collect the score boosters around the map while surviving to increase your score.

Scoring:

your score.
