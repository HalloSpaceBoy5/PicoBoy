Starship User Manual

Game Overview:
Starship is a game where you dodge projectiles and stay alive for a certain amount of time. As the level
increases, the amount of time increases, as does the number of enemies. Starship was originally a game
written for the GameBoy by HalloSpaceBoy, but was ported to the PicoBoy for its better graphics.

Important things to know:
- Your score will only be saved when you die; if you return to the home screen before that, your score will be
  lost.
- Your number of lives resets at the beginning of every level

Gameplay:
You control a spaceship, and your main goal is to dodge the projectiles fired at you by enemy ships. After a 
certian amount of time alive, you will pass the level and move on. If you lose all 3 lives in this time, you
will get a game over. In Starship, there are two different kinds of enemies: static enemies and follower enemies. 
Static enemies will stay in place and fire at a set rate; follower enemies will follow you on whatever axis
they move on while firing at you.
