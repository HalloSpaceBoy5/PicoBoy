Pac Man User Manual

Game Overview:
This is a port of the 1980 arcade classic Pac Man for the PicoBoy. It is a game where you eat pellets and run
away from ghosts. This port has all of the same rules with a simplified ghost AI to fit on the PicoBoy. 

Important things to know:
- Your score will only be saved when you die; if you return to the home screen before that, your score will be
  lost.
- At 5000 points, you will get a 1UP

Gameplay:
In Pac Man, your main goal is to consume all of the pellets in the maze that you are trapped in. While you collect
the pellets, you are chased by 4 ghosts: Blinky, Inky, Pinky, and Clyde. Each of these ghosts has a different AI
that is chasing you. Even though these ghosts are threatening, you can turn the tables on them by eating a power
pellet. This will make the ghosts scared, making them eatable for points. After clearing the maze of all of the
pellets, you will get a win screen. If you are killed by a ghost and lose all of your lives, you will get a game 
over.
