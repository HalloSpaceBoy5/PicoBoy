Breakout User Manual

Game Overview:
Breakout is a rewritten version of the game Breakout for the Atari 2600. It is a game where you control a paddle.
and try to bounce a ball off of it to break an array of colored blocks.

Important things to know:
- Your score will only be saved when you die; if you return to the home screen before that, your score will be
  lost.
- The speed of the ball increases as you progress.

Gameplay:
When you start a new round, your paddle will be in the middle of the screen. You can press the A button to send
the ball off and begin playing. After breaking all of the blocks, you will encounter a win screen. Pressing A on
the win screen will start a new round with your score in tact. You can find your lives in the upper right corner
of the screen , and your score in the upper left. When your lives run out, you will get a death screen. When the 
death screen occurs, your score will be saved to the leaderboard.

Controls:
A - Launch ball
Left - Move paddle left
Right - Move paddle right
Start - Pause game/view scores

Scoring:
1st row: 100 points
2nd row: 50 points
3rd row: 25 points
4th row: 10 points
5th row: 5 points

Tips:
- Position your paddle to where the ball is going to be rather than where it is.
- Try to get the ball bouncing between blocks to increase the score fast.
