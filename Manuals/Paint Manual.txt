How do I save my drawings to my computer?
You can use the PicoBoy Drawing Exporter. Instructions for how to use the exporter follow:
1. Connect your PicoBoy to your computer
2. Open the PicoBoy Drawing Exporter (Your computer will flag it as malware, I promise it is not)
3. From the "Select Port" dropdown, select your PicoBoy (On windows, it will be called "USB Serial Device". On Mac, it will be called "Board in FS mode")
4. Click connect. If you get an error, consult the user manual on connecting. PicoBoy Communication Software uses the same protocol as PicoBoy Drawing Exporter
5. From the "Choose Drawing" dropdown, select the drawing you want to download
6. Click "Download Drawing". If you get an error, make sure that the drawing isn'c corrupted and your PicoBoy has a good connection to your computer.
7. After a second, you should recieve a notification about a successful download. The notification will contain the path the drawing is downloaded to.
