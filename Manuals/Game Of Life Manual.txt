Game Of Life User Manual

Game Overview:
In the Game Of Life, a set of pixels are added to or subtracted from in accordance with these rules:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
If a live cell has 0 or 1 live neighbors, it dies in the next generation.

- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation.
If a live cell has 2 or 3 live neighbors, it remains alive in the next generation.

- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
If a live cell has more than 3 live neighbors, it dies in the next generation.

- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
If a dead cell has exactly 3 live neighbors, it becomes alive in the next generation.

Following these rules, a simulation will play out that you can watch.

Important things to know:
- This is a zero-player game. There is no score and no lives.Â 
- If the simulation dies, you will go back to the drawing board.

Gameplay:
You can either draw patterns or choose random patterns to create your cells. You can then begin the simulation.
and watch the Game Of Life play out.

Controls:
Up - Move cursor up
Down - Move cursor down
Left - Move cursor left
Right - Move cursor right
A - Create cell
B - Destroy cell
Select - Create random pattern on screen
Start - Begin simulation/End simulation prematurely

Scoring:
There is no scoring.

Tips:
- Experiment! Have fun trying out ideas for cellular growth and patterns!
