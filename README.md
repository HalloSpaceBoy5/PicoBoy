The PicoBoy is a videogame console based off of the Raspberry Pi Pico that you can build yourself. The building process is relativley easy and is a fun way to spend an afternoon. You can buy the electronic components off of the Tindie store and the get the software from this repository for free. You can get the files for the printed case from this link: https://www.printables.com/model/469537-picoboy

# Bulding the Console
Building the console requires that you have at least a little bit of soldering expierence. This is because there are a few tricky parts where you may be challenged. As long as you follow the build guide, you should have no problems and a completed PicoBoy!

# Using the Console
Using the console is dead simple. You have a main menu where you can pick the game you wish to play. Anything that you need can be accomodated by the user guide. Have fun with your PicoBoy!

# Devoloping for the console
I have yet to begin work on a Software Devolopment Kit (SDK). This is because I do not want to invest time into making it if no one wants to use it. If I see people asking for an SDK on the discord, I will make one.

# Using the PicoBoy Communication Software
The PicoBoy Communication Software is a handy peice of software that makes it easy to modifiy your PicoBoy. It can add games, delete games, and format the console. Upon opening, Windows may warn you saying that it is suspicious software. I promise it isin't, I wrote it myself. To use the software, follow the instructions for each function in the user guide.
