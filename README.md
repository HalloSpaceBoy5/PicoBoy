# Bulding the Console
Building the console is an enjoyable expierence that helps beginners learn to solder and experts have a fun time with very little challenge. Building the PicoBoy is optional, as there is an option for a pre-built console at checkout.

# Using the Console
Using the console is dead simple. You navigate PBOS (PicoBoy Operating System), an easy to use, customizable operating system specifically for the PicoBoy. It supports 5 languages, custom backgrounds, and many more features.

# Devoloping for the console
The PicoBoy SDK is avalible and easy to use! It makes developing games as easy as possible for newer developers, while being incredibly powerful allowing the performance of complex tasks for expert developers.

# Using the PicoBoy Communication Software
The PicoBoy Communication Software is a handy peice of software that makes it easy to modifiy your PicoBoy. It can add games, delete games, format the console, update the console, customize the console, as well as many more features. Upon opening, Your computer may warn you saying that it is suspicious software. I promise it isin't, I wrote it myself. The reason your computer warns you is because the software is not signed with a certified software key, which I do not have the budget for. To use the software, follow the instructions for each function in the user guide.
